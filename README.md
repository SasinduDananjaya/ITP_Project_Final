#### Brief Description of Project - The purpose of this web application is to implement and automate the management tasks of a company which sells and repairs computer spare parts. Main problem faced by the company is it is not possible to record all the data and information manually in a practical environment.

The system is designed to deliver web-based solutions to deal with several problems that a company face when working with its management purposes. It represents the approach of identifying, clarifying and organizing requirements of a computer spare parts management system. The main actors of the system are admin, employee and customer. These actors are given privileges to perform different tasks such as managing inventory, bills and reports.

The application collects details of the customers, suppliers, employees and spare parts which are accessible only through the relevant access levels of the company system. It enables user to generate reports of buying, selling and stock management details of the company for a specific time-period. There is an additional function in the system to manage customer requests for the computer software and hardware repairs. Admin can access and control customer details, manage buying and selling functions. Furthermore, customers can buy or request to repair hardware/software using the web application.

As described above, this web application can lead to an error free, reliable, secure and fast management system with a better utilization of resources.
